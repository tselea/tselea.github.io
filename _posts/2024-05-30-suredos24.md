Glad to present at SUREDOS24!

I had the opportunity to present our work at the SUREDOS24 Workshop in Frascati, Italy, focused on Super-Resolution and Downscaling for Earth Observation and Earth Science. The event brought together leading researchers to explore how advanced techniques, like deep learning, can enhance the spatial and spectral resolution of Earth Observation data. My presentation, titled "Super-Resolving Waste Dumps from Space," discussed innovative methods for enhancing satellite imagery to detect environmental crimes in Romania. It was inspiring to engage with experts in the field and exchange ideas on the future of super-resolution techniques for Earth Observation. Iâ€™m excited to continue contributing to advancements in this area!
